They eventually went to other couples who were years ahead of them, and compiled a list of biblical lifestyles of “rhythms” that married couples can create in their lives. In this interview, they’ll focus on the important rhythms that have helped them through the years, and how God uses those rhythms to draw us closer to Him.",

And to this day, the Jewish people have continued to make their way back to their God-given land.
